NOTE: Assignment 1 and 2 have been implemented in the same code.

We have two java programs - Master.java and Slave.java

Step 1 : Compile and run Master.java (Master represents the time daemon)
Step 2 : Enter the number of nodes you are going to create.(number of times you will execute Slave.java)
Step 3 : Compile and run Slave.java (each slave represents one node)
 
Once you have entered the number of nodes and created the same number of nodes (By executing Slave.java), the master will exit once all the nodes have synchronized. 

After synchronization, the nodes will start sending messages to each other. (PART II)
